# X-Road
- Authentication
	- 'this is me'
- Encryption
	- only you can read if you are authenticated
- Consent / Signing
	- I agree to this document
- Build the existing back-end systems
- databases can be distributed but communicate with each-other like micro services
- localization are not bad but in-efficient
- Start with building smaller feature but have the vision

# Asset Management
- have a simple ER diagram 
	- Institutions has many 
		- Assets 
		- Public Services
		- Systems has many
			- Data Service or "Machines"

- Central system 
- Public Services, Institutions, Systems, Services, Assets
- enpass.io
- `upmind.ee`
	- open source
	- Blade framework
	- Java and MongoDB

# Zero Trust Access | Security Control 
- IT Policies 
	- By selecting open standards choices: ISO 27000-familiy of standards, NIST, Gruntschuzts, ...
	- Study and build skills (business, architecture, dev, maintenance, supervision) - implement/adopt
	- Supervison + audit
	- Information security must become standard process, not a project!

# Inter-operability principles
- For election, update the master Green Book DB and you don't need election data
- Owner dictates who and what data is shared

# E-Filing
- document management system
- may be merged with Budgeting app.
- we may have off the shelf products
- make sure TCRC is capable of maintenance in the long run

# Digital Signature and Digital Identity 
- Identification and Signature goes hand in hand
- PKI
- Usb token
- Get services to use the digital identity otherwise no one will use it
- people should be able to see their info in the GB data

# Security is about
- confidentiality
- data availability
- data integrity

# Governance efficiency and transparency 
- Digital Transformation Council 
	- Involved in Action Plan
	- Opinion leaders 
- Digital divide (Keep offices, some people don't use internet)
- avoid vendor lock in

# Digital Coordination Committee (CIO)
- Asset management
- Preparing e-Government strategies and action plan
- `CIOs`, should be horizontal, empowered and manage the direction of the CTA as a whole
- the CIOs does not need to be a Programmer
- tie up tech and services
- CIOs should monitor later

# Central Implementation of IOF
- data exchange layer and monitoring
- metadata
- Infrastructure

# Capacity building
- PSC could train regarding capabilities of tech.
- TCRC will not be able to develop for everyone 

# Involving TCRC in all IT related projects
- good for maintenance
- relates to enforcement of IT policy
- This relates to security. If TCRC can't maintain it, It's a security risk.

# E-Parliament
- Look to HP Parliament
- use E-Filing in parliament (1/3 of the work is done for E-Parliament)

# Mission / Objective
- Preservation of culture
- Governance
	- Process optimization by digitization
	- Relation of CTA with the public
	- Welfare of Tibetans in exile

# Funding / Sustainability 
- set up principles that says to the donors that some money needs to be set aside for maintenance
- ask for a portion of CTA's own budget for maintenance 


# A Rinzin's notes
- Prioritizing and consolidating 
-   Focusing on prerequisites and baseline requirements.
-   Focusing on how the data management will work
-   Understanding the different metadata
-   Do something simple and cheaper first
-   Rules and Regulations to be in place
-   Step by step.. Not everything can be done at once
-   Non-technical vision also needs to be taken into consideration.
-   You and your data become legacy once you depend on any service Providers, so it's better not to depend too much on any service providers.
-   Donâ€™t protect infrastructure, protect information.
-   The geography of where your data is stored in the cloud is important.
